**Project Overview: Predictive Modeling for Loan Default**

1. **Data Acquisition:**
   - Acquired a dataset from [source] containing information about loan applications.
   - Explored the dataset to understand its structure and features.

2. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:**
   - Checked for missing values and handled them appropriately.
   - Converted categorical variables into a suitable format for modeling.
   - Performed feature engineering to create relevant features.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Conducted EDA to gain insights into the distribution of key variables.
   - Visualized relationships between features and the target variable (payment default).

4. **Handling Class Imbalance:**
   - Addressed the issue of class imbalance in the target variable.
   - Used oversampling techniques to balance the number of default and non-default cases.

5. **Feature Scaling and Selection:**
   - Standardized numerical features to ensure all variables contribute equally to the model.
   - Explored feature correlations and selected relevant features for modeling.

6. **Model Building:**
   - Trained and evaluated three different models: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest.
   - Utilized grid search for hyperparameter tuning to enhance model performance.

7. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Assessed models using key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC.
   - Compared performance across different algorithms to identify the most effective one.

**Results:**

1. **Logistic Regression:**
   - Accuracy: 59.55%
